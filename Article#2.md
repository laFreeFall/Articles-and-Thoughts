David Emerson: What inspired you to create a brand new framework rather than contributing to an existing one?

Taylor Otwell: There were things that frustrated me about other frameworks – for example, trying to code common features quickly like authentication were not simple to do in other frameworks. 
I also had trouble figuring out how to do things in other frameworks, and I wanted to be able to start new ideas quickly rather than spend a lot of time writing boilerplate code.

I came from the .NET world and was inspired by other languages like .NET (which has features like dependency injection in controllers, for example). 
It wasn’t easy for me to modify other frameworks to add these ideas, so starting another framework seemed like the easiest thing to do. 
I started Laravel mainly for myself, and then I wrote documentation and opened it up for other people to use it too.
