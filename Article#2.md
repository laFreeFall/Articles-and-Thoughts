### What inspired you to create a brand new framework rather than contributing to an existing one?

**Taylor Otwell**: 
> There were things that frustrated me about other frameworks – for example, trying to code common features quickly like authentication were not simple to do in other frameworks. 
I also had trouble figuring out how to do things in other frameworks, and I wanted to be able to start new ideas quickly rather than spend a lot of time writing boilerplate code.

> I came from the .NET world and was inspired by other languages like .NET (which has features like dependency injection in controllers, for example). 
It wasn’t easy for me to modify other frameworks to add these ideas, so starting another framework seemed like the easiest thing to do. 
I started Laravel mainly for myself, and then I wrote documentation and opened it up for other people to use it too.

**My humble opinion as newbie student who tries to become a programmer about that**
Sincerely to say, in the Taylor's answer are main reasong why I felt in love with Laravel. 
The main reason, I think, why this project is so successful is that framework initially was developed for Taylor himself. 
Not for money, not for fame or something like that. 
He just saw that other frameworks existed at that time were not the thing he would like to use every day without any problems. 
Having great experience on different spheres he created really something unique, what didn't exist before. 
He took some stuff from different languages, different technologies, different approaches, created something from scratch and got absolutely incredible result. 
It is such easy and comfortable framework, that it's just a pleasure to work with Laravel.

P.S. Even now I realise how great is such tutorial personally for me. 
Before that I worked with VCS using PHPStorm built-in GUI. 
And only now I understood at least a bit how it works on a lower level.
Anyway it was a great experience and something changed in my mind.
Thanks a lot for that.
